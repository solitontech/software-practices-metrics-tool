## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the
[Software Practices Metrics Tool Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable
behavior to <sathish.thangavel@solitontech.com>.

## I Have a Question

Before you ask a question, it is best to search for existing [Issues](https://github.com/solitontech/software-practices-metrics-tool/issues)
that might help you. In case you have found a suitable issue and still need
clarification, you can write your question in this issue.
It is also advisable to search the internet for answers first.

If you then still feel the need to ask a question and need clarification, we
recommend the following:

- Open an [Issue](https://github.com/solitontech/software-practices-metrics-tool/issues/new).
- Provide as much context as you can about what you're running into.
- Provide project and platform versions (nodejs, npm, etc), depending on what seems
  relevant.

We will then take care of the issue as soon as possible.

### Reporting Bugs

<!-- omit in toc -->

#### Before Submitting a Bug Report

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information.
Therefore, we ask you to investigate carefully, collect information and describe
the issue in detail in your report. Please complete the following steps in advance
to help us fix any potential bug as fast as possible.

- Make sure that you are using the latest version.
- Determine if your bug is really a bug and not an error on your side e.g. using
  incompatible environment components/versions or configs.
- To see if other users have experienced (and potentially already solved) the
  same issue you are having, check if there is not already a bug report existing
  for your bug or error in the [bug tracker](https://github.com/solitontech/software-practices-metrics-tool/issues?q=label%3Abug).
- Also make sure to search the internet (including Stack Overflow) to see if
  users outside of the GitHub community have discussed the issue.
- Collect information about the bug:
  - Stack trace (Traceback)
  - Possibly your input and the output
  - Can you reliably reproduce the issue? And can you also reproduce it with
    older versions?

#### How Do I Submit a Good Bug Report?

> You must never report security related issues, vulnerabilities or bugs including
> sensitive information to the issue tracker, or elsewhere in public. Instead
> sensitive bugs must be sent by email to <techops@solitontech.com>.

<!-- You may add a PGP key to allow the messages to be sent encrypted as well. -->

We use GitHub issues to track bugs and errors. If you run into an issue with the
project:

- Open an [Issue](https://github.com/solitontech/software-practices-metrics-tool/issues/new). (Since we can't be sure at this point whether it
  is a bug or not, we ask you not to talk about a bug yet and not to label the issue.)
- Explain the behavior you would expect and the actual behavior.
- Please provide as much context as possible and describe the _reproduction steps_
  that someone else can follow to recreate the issue on their own. This usually
  includes your code. For good bug reports you should isolate the problem and
  create a reduced test case.
- Provide the information you collected in the previous section.

Once it's filed:

- The project team will label the issue accordingly.
- A team member will try to reproduce the issue with your provided steps. If there
  are no reproduction steps or no obvious way to reproduce the issue, the team
  will ask you for those steps and mark the issue as `needs-repro`. Bugs with
  the `needs-repro` tag will not be addressed until they are reproduced.
- If the team is able to reproduce the issue, it will be marked `needs-fix`,
  as well as possibly other tags (such as `critical`), and the issue will be
  left to be implemented by someone.

### Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion for
Software Practices Metrics Tool,
**including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality**.
Following these guidelines will help maintainers and the community to understand
your suggestion and find related suggestions.

<!-- omit in toc -->

#### Before Submitting an Enhancement

- Make sure that you are using the latest version.
- Perform a [search](https://github.com/solitontech/software-practices-metrics-tool/issues) to see if the enhancement has already been suggested.
  If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.
- Find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project. It's
  up to you to make a strong case to convince the project's developers of the
  merits of this feature. Keep in mind that we want features that will be useful
  to the majority of our users and not just a small subset. If you're just targeting
  a minority of users, consider writing an add-on/plugin library.

<!-- omit in toc -->

#### How Do I Submit a Good Enhancement Suggestion?

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://github.com/solitontech/software-practices-metrics-tool/issues).

- Use a **clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion.
- Provide a **step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** in as many
  details as possible.
- **Describe the current behavior** and
  **explain which behavior you expected to see instead** and why. At this point
  you can also tell which alternatives do not work for you.
- You may want to **include screenshots and animated GIFs** which help you
  demonstrate the steps or point out the part which the suggestion is related to.
  You can use [this tool](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/)
  to record GIFs on macOS and Windows, and
  [this tool](https://github.com/colinkeenan/silentcast) or
  [this tool](https://github.com/GNOME/byzanz) on Linux.
- **Explain why this enhancement would be useful** to most
  Software Practices Metrics Tool users. You may also want to point out the
  other projects that solved it better and which could serve as inspiration.
