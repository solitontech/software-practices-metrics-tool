 running the following command in terminal:

   ```bash
   npm run start:dev
   ```

2. The above command will execute the specified script in the `scripts`

   [http://localhost:3498](http://localhost:3498) and access the application.

## Run application in production

## Test the Application

1. This repository consists of unit, integration tests for server.
2. You can generate test coverage by executing the following command

```bash
# command to run unit & integration tests
$ npm run test
```

## Linting & formatting

Linting and formatting are essential for maintaining code quality and consistency
 throughout a project.

**1. Check for Linting Issues:**

   ```bash
   npm run lint
   ```

   This command runs the linter to check for any syntax errors, code style
    violations, or potential bugs in your codebase. It provides a report of
     any issues found, helping you identify areas for improvement.

**2. Format Codebase:**

   ```bash
   npm run format
   ```

   This command formats your codebase according to the configured code style
    rules. It helps maintain consistency in code formatting across different
     files and modules, making the codebase easier to read and understand.
