# Software Practices Metrics Tool

This repository contains the backend code for API's related to Software
Practices Metrics tool.

## Getting Started

Follow the installation instructions below to set up the project.

## Installation

### 1. Set Up Your Environment

Refer [Get Started](../README.md#getting-started) for setting up repository and
install dependencies.

### 2. Start the application

1. Once the dependencies are installed, make sure you have configured
server-config.json in configs directory follow the steps
[Configure server configuration file](#configure-server-configuration-file).

2. After configuring you can start the application by
 running the following command in terminal:

   ```bash
   npm run start:dev
   ```

3. The above command will execute the specified script in the `scripts`
section of the `package.json` file, typically
used for starting the development server.

### 3. Access the Application

1. Once the development server is running, open your web browser and go to the address
   [http://localhost:3498](http://localhost:3498) and access the application.

## Test the Application

1. This repository consists of unit, integration tests for server.
2. You can generate test coverage by executing the following command

```bash
# command to run unit & integration tests
$ npm run test
```

## Linting & formatting

Linting and formatting are essential for maintaining code quality and consistency
throughout a project.

**1. Check for Linting Issues:**

   ```bash
   npm run lint
   ```

   This command runs the linter to check for any syntax errors, code style
   violations, or potential bugs in your codebase. It provides a report of
   any issues found, helping you identify areas for improvement.

**2. Fix Linting Issues Automatically:**

   ```bash
   npm run lint-fix
   ```

   This command not only checks for linting issues but also attempts to
   automatically fix them where possible. It's useful for quickly addressing
   common issues and ensuring that your code follows the defined coding standards.

**3. Format check:**

   ```bash
   npm run format-check
   ```

   This command runs the formatter to check for any css formatting violations in
   your codebase. It provides a report of any issues found, helping you identify
   areas for improvement.

**4. Format Codebase:**

   ```bash
   npm run format
   ```

   This command formats your codebase according to the configured code style
   rules. It helps maintain consistency in code formatting across different
   files and modules, making the codebase easier to read and understand.

## Configure server configuration file

To connect the Software Practices Metrics Tool to your Azure DevOps repositories,
you need to configure the server configuration file named `server-config.json`.
This file contains the necessary settings for authentication and repository connection.

Below is an example of the `server-config.json` file:

```json
{
"targetBranch": "main",
"organization": "Soliton",
"projectName": "my_project",
"repositoryId": "my_repository",
"authToken": "my_auth_token",
"squads": []
}
```

**Server Configuration File Breakdown:**

The `server-config.json` file in server directory contains the necessary settings
 to connect the Software Practices Metrics Tool to your Azure DevOps repositories.
  Below is a breakdown of each configuration option:

- **`targetBranch`:**  
The default branch in your Azure DevOps repository.

- **`organization`:**  
The name of your Azure DevOps organization.

- **`projectName`:**  
The name of your project within the Azure DevOps organization.

- **`repositoryId`:**  
The ID of the repository you want to connect to.

- **`authToken`:**  
Your personal access token (PAT) for authentication. You can follow the steps outlined
 [here](#steps-to-create-azure-devops-token) to create a PAT.

- **`squads`:**  
An optional field for defining squads or teams associated with the project. You
can follow steps outlined [here](#using-squads-in-server-configjson-file)
 to configure squads.

Make sure to replace the placeholder values `my_project`, `my_repository`,
 `my_auth_token`, etc. with your actual Azure DevOps project details and
  personal access token.

Once you've configured the `server-config.json` file, you'll be ready to connect
 the tool to your Azure DevOps repositories.

## Steps to create Azure devops Token

1. Sign up to [Azure Devops](https://dev.azure.com/).

2. Find Personal access tokens in user settings (beside profile picture).

3. Click on Personal access tokens.

4. Create new Token by clicking on `New Token`.

5. Enter a name for your token.

6. Choose the organization where you want to use the token.

7. Set the expiration, scopes as `Custom defined` and tick `Read` for Code.

8. Click on `Create`.

9. Ensure to copy and save the token value as **it won't be recoverable if lost.**

## Using squads in server-config.json file

1. Please refer [Steps to get developer uuid](#steps-to-get-developer-uuid) &
 [Steps to get reviewer uuid](#steps-to-get-reviewer-uuid)
to know how to get the uuids using our tool before starting with below steps.

2. Update squads in `server-config.json` with relevant details
 for filtering in the application. Refer below format.

    ```JSON
    squads:[
        {
            "squadName": "Squad_name",
            "developers": {
                "9e1413a9-2b7c-6556-b441-e1eabfed5d43": "Developer_name"
            },
            "reviewers": {
                "4c56f2d9-f179-65fd-af3d-0650c183e580": "Reviewer_name"
            }
        }
    ]
    ```

3. Ensure entering unique squad name to avoid confusion. And enter the details
of developers and reviewers as array of key value pairs specified in the below
format.
   - `developer_uuid (or) reviewer_uuid : developer_name (or) reviewer_name`

### Steps to get developer uuid

1. Open the application & got to code review page.

2. And use browser dev tools to inspect on code review table.

3. Using the select in dev tools, click on the author name in the code review
 table and go to inspect tab to get developer name and uuid
  from the title tag of the html element.

4. Also you can get uuid from data-uuid tag of html element.

5. Copy and paste the name & uuid in `server-config.json` in specified format.

### Steps to get reviewer uuid

1. Open the application & got to code review page.

2. Check in votes history timeline or current votes timeline for reviewers.

3. And use browser dev tools to inspect on timeline table.

4. Using the select in dev tools, click on the reviewer name in the timeline
 table and go to inspect tab to get reviewer name and uuid from
  the title tag of the html element.

5. Also you can get uuid from data-uuid tag of html element.

6. Copy and paste the name & uuid in `server-config.json` in specified format.

### Note

1. Squads are useful when you are working
 on large repository with a high volume of pull requests or you are
 finding it difficult to search your team pull requests.

2. Squads are optional configuration.

3. In a squad, reviewers are not required fields, while at least one developer
 is mandatory. Refer below format.

    ```JSON
   squads:[
      {
         "squadName": "Squad_name",
         "developers": {
            "9e1413a9-2b7c-6556-b441-e1eabfed5d43": "Developer_name"
         }
      }
   ] 
   ```

4. If you set reviewers for squads and select them in the application,
 only pull requests containing those reviewers will be filtered.

5. A reviewer is recognized as such for a pull request only if they've given
 any vote on it.

6. Ensure you enter same name for developers & reviewers section in the
 `server-config.json` which will be displayed in the dashboard to avoid confusion.
